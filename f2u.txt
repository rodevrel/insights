Hello, my name is Amber, I work for the company AIM INTERACTIVE LLC. as a marketting director, I will be talking about our business model.
We really do love the open source community, so we do fund that and provide many open source projects.
First things first, we are not a big company, we are usually well known in schools in specific areas, and we do not advertise. We work with big companies behind the scenes (and we are starting to work with DISCORD servers).

FOR PEOPLE LOOKING FOR ARTIST: We have artist that will help with anything, as of right now we are trying to help with DISCORD servers and small companies.
FOR PEOPLE LOOKING FOR COMPOSERS: We have few-but talented-music composers. They usually work with VIOLIN or GUITAR.

Our companies future: There is no secret! We are completely transparent, and recently we have announced the Aimオペレーティングシステム. We are planning on releasing it in the next year. Our partnerships are for growth so we can get a successful release.
The gaming market is SUPER competitive, so we are planning on releasing alot of things for new developers. We also will be making software for music composers and graphical artist.

Trademarks:
For artwork and music we provide for partners, we expect just compensation. This may be just a quick copyright disclaimer or a flat fee, at the most 10 USD. We have all rights to the artwork and music still.

Software:
For artwork and music software we provide for partners, we expect partners to not distribute it, this will be mentioned in the LICENSE file and may lead to big trouble.
